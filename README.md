# Flexime

## What is this?

This is a web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to allow
users to build resumes tailored to certain positions, using certain projects
and skills when applicable.

This project allows users to upload a [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/schema)
file which will be parsed into a custom format to be more modular so individuals
can select certain components to include.

## Getting Started With Developing

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
